"The next Australian User Group Meeting will be held on Wednesday September
12th. Unfortunately this is in term time, but it will give those from interstate
and New Zealand an opportunity to attend, given that the "Symposium on Language
Design ...." is being held in Sydney that week. Also Dennis Ritchie will attend,
in fact he will be giving a talk at the meeting on UNIX Version 7."

much enhanced level 6 that has been developed at the Uni-
versities of New South Wales and Sydney.  It is referred to as
