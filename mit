"And I had signed--I signed the initial agreement between MIT and
Western Electric, which was--had been handling the--the patent things of
Bell Labs, Bell Telephone Labs, for the UNIX environment. And so for a year or
two, I was the only signature on this thing. But later on, when the rest of MIT
began to see that UNIX was the--the thing to go with, then they just simply
appended their own signatures, so--but I was, sort of, the--the initial UNIX
thing here."

"1973
* EMS was founded by Professor Barry Vercoe.  The original studio was located
  in the basement of Building 26. Later the studio was moved up to the third
  floor and occupied the former laboratory of Amar Bose.
* Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC) donated a PDP-11/50 computer which became one of
  the central tools of the studio along with an IMLAC PDS-4 computer."

"I don't know exactly when the first one arrived, but I'm pretty sure it
was around the end of my freshman year (i.e. the summmer of '75), because I
remember a friend showing me Unix sometime in my sophmore year, and they
already had it as a going concern then.

The first one (I think) at MIT was the 11/70 belonging to the Domain-Specific
Systems Research group at LCS (DSSR)."
