"The department acquired its first general purpose computer, a VAX 11/780 in
1978.  It was the first VAX to be running VAX UNIX outside the developer's sites
(Berkeley and Bell Labs)."

"REVIEW: At Purdue, you started out with PDP-11s, didn't you?
GOBLE: Right, 11/45s and 11/70s -- then VAXen, dual VAXen and now the Gould."
