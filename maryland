"The Department computer laboratory started under the Center approximately
in 1971. Perhaps the first computers obtained for the Laboratory were a
PDP-11/45 obtained by Kanal under an NSF research grant for research in
pattern recognition
...
Kanal also obtained the first license from Bell Laboratories to use the UNIX
operating system for the entire university. This came about when Dr. David Mills
told Kanal that the UNIX operating system should be used on the PDP-11/45."
