"Alvy Ray Smith:
we got to Utah, these two freaky looking guys, and our goal was to
get somehow access to this frame buffer that was being built so we could
make this new kind of art.  And they said, they took a look at us and said,
you know we're department of defense funded, but and here's the big but,
there was this rich man who just came through recently from Long Island
New York and bought one of everything in sight -- and I said including
the framebuffer -- and he says yup.

Michael Rubin:
And this is Martin Newell who said this to you correct?

Alvy Ray Smith
I believe it was."

"Ron Baecker, from the University of Toronto and briefly a housemate of mine in
Redwood City, California, soon informed us of a bright new computer system
exciting the universities. It was called Unix, from AT&T's prestigious Bell
Labs. It came complete with a high-level programming language simply called C
and could be bought for a song (about a hundred dollars) by educational
institutions like NYIT. We purchased Unix and immediately became enamored of it
and its language C. They were logical, natural, and simple."
